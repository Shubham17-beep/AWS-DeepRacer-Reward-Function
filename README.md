# AWS-DeepRacer

We have recently participated in an internal event at Barclays, organized by the AWS team, focusing on AWS DeepRacerâ€” a reinforcement learning-based autonomous racing platform. During this event, We engaged in extensive hyperparameter tuning and developed a custom reward function to optimize our model's performance. Our efforts culminated in achieving a best lap time of 7.922 seconds, securing a position in the top 20 teams.

This experience has deepened my understanding of reinforcement learning and its practical applications, particularly in the realm of autonomous vehicle navigation. It also highlighted the importance of iterative testing and optimization in achieving competitive results.
